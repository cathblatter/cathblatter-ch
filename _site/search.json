The boundaries correspond to district, not cantonal level (what I wanted). As the variable KTNR identifies the cantons, I did the following:\n\n# draw a ggplot and changed to aes(....group = KTNR)\nggplot(d, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = KTNR)) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = factor(region)), color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Region\",\n                   values = c(\"Ticino\" = \"grey90\",\n                              \"Romandie\" = \"#b2df8a\",\n                              \"Deutschschweiz\" = \"#a6cee3\")) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_equal()\n\n\n\n\n…It got even worse…\nI did not understand why at first. After a brief online exchange in the Rladies-Slack (sidenote: fantastic place to learn! 😎), I realized that my problem is with the data: aes(x = long, y = lat) in my dataframe correspond to district level not cantonal level. Unfortunately, the link on the website of the Federal Office of Statistics didn’t work either1, so what to do else?\nLook at the data structure:\n\n# a list containing 8 elements (dataframes)\n# which each contain lon/lat on different levels\nclass(shp_df)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n# very long output, not shown here\n#str(shp_df)\n\nI now knew that I could use the plot from above and check each element of the list - either by hand (corresponding to seven times copy/paste) or with purrr::map()!\n\n\nSolution\n\n# create a function to map over each element of the list to\n# identify if one is on cantonal-level\nmy_plot <- function(data){\n  \n  ggplot2::ggplot(data = data, ggplot2::aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_polygon() +\n    ggplot2::theme_void() +\n    coord_equal()\n  \n}\n\nThen do the magic (1 simple line of code will give me 8 plots!):\n\n# map it over the list\npurrr::map(ggswissmaps::shp_df, ~my_plot(.x))\n\n$g1b15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1g15_encl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1g15_li\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1g15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1k15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1l15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1r15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$g1s15\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plots above I now know which dataframe to use:\n\n# solution: the second last element of the list is what I need\ncant_level <- \n  ggswissmaps::shp_df$g1k15 %>% \n      mutate(region = case_when(KTNR == 21 ~ \"Ticino\",\n                                KTNR  %in% c(22, 23, 24, 25, 26) ~ \"Romandie\",\n                                TRUE ~ \"Deutschschweiz\"))\n\n# draw the prettier graph\nggplot(cant_level, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = factor(region))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Region\",\n                   values = c(\"Ticino\" = \"grey90\",\n                              \"Romandie\" = \"#b2df8a\",\n                              \"Deutschschweiz\" = \"#a6cee3\")) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_equal()\n\n\n\n\nThe output is what I wanted - altough we could improve it, as the lakes (which are left out in the district-level data) are not shown here…\nEdit:\nthanks to the ggswissmaps-maintainer gibo’s help, the maps look now much prettier:\n\nggplot(cant_level, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = factor(region)), color = \"white\", size = 0.1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Region\",\n                    values = c(\"Ticino\" = \"grey90\",\n                               \"Romandie\" = \"#b2df8a\",\n                               \"Deutschschweiz\" = \"#a6cee3\")) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_equal() + # add a layer for the lakes\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), \n               data = shp_df[[\"g1s15\"]], fill = NA, alpha = .5, color = \"#0529B3\", size = .1, lty = \"solid\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nIn the meantime, the package maintainer provided me with the working links: https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/services/geostat/geodonnees-statistique-federale.html.↩︎"

    "text": "TL;DR\nThis code shows you how you can effectively wrangle your dataframe from wide to long using tidyr::pivot_longer() combined with regular expressions for properly naming the variables.\n\n\nYour data is… not in the right format!\nYou have a wide dataset of patient data, each patient identified through ID. They have been hospitalised multiple times, each place of hospitalisation and outcome listed in its own variable. Place and Outcome of a hospitalization are linked with the same suffix number, e.g. _2_2:\n\n# load packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\n# create sample data\npatient_data <- \ntibble::tribble(~ID, ~Hosp_Place_1, ~Hosp_Outcome_1, ~Hosp_Place_2_2, \n                ~Hosp_Outcome_2_2, ~Hosp_Place_2_3, ~Hosp_Outcome_2_3, \n                1, \"London\", \"Alive\", \"Paris\", \"alive\", \"Rome\", \"dead\",\n                2, \"Paris\", \"alive\", \"Rome\", \"alive\", \"London\", \"alive\",\n                3, \"Berne\", \"dead\", NA_character_, NA_character_, NA_character_, NA_character_) \n\n# look at data\npatient_data\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n     ID Hosp_Place_1 Hosp_Outcome_1 Hosp_Place_2_2 Hosp_Outcom…¹ Hosp_…² Hosp_…³\n  <dbl> <chr>        <chr>          <chr>          <chr>         <chr>   <chr>  \n1     1 London       Alive          Paris          alive         Rome    dead   \n2     2 Paris        alive          Rome           alive         London  alive  \n3     3 Berne        dead           <NA>           <NA>          <NA>    <NA>   \n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​Hosp_Outcome_2_2, ²​Hosp_Place_2_3,\n#   ³​Hosp_Outcome_2_3\n\n\nPatient No. 3 died in his first hospitatisation, so the following variables are listed NA.\nFor some analysis, this data structure would work ok, but for your specific questions you need to switch the unit of analysis to “hospitalisation” instead of “patient”. In other words, you’d like to switch the data from wide to long.\nThanks to the tidyverse’s initiative of making clear function names, it might be obvious, that tidyr::pivot_longer() should do what you want.\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the function - What to do with tidyr::pivot_longer()?\nThe first step is to initially think about, what the outcome should look like and what input-arguments the function takes, so let’s do this:\n\n# tidyr::pivot_long() and its arguments\ntidyr::pivot_longer(data, \n                    cols, \n                    names_to = \"name\", \n                    names_prefix = NULL, \n                    names_sep = NULL, \n                    names_pattern = NULL,\n                    names_ptypes = list(),\n                    names_repair = \"check_unique\",\n                    values_to = \"value\",\n                    values_drop_na = FALSE,\n                    values_ptypes = list())\n\nAs you can see, only data and cols are effectively needed, so let’s try that. As I want to exclude the Patient-ID from pivoting, I remove this line from pivoting:\n\n# as with all the tidyverse functions you can easily pipe-in the data as \n# the first argument\n\n# '-ID' means, that all variables are used other than ID\npatient_data %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = -ID)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 3\n      ID name             value \n   <dbl> <chr>            <chr> \n 1     1 Hosp_Place_1     London\n 2     1 Hosp_Outcome_1   Alive \n 3     1 Hosp_Place_2_2   Paris \n 4     1 Hosp_Outcome_2_2 alive \n 5     1 Hosp_Place_2_3   Rome  \n 6     1 Hosp_Outcome_2_3 dead  \n 7     2 Hosp_Place_1     Paris \n 8     2 Hosp_Outcome_1   alive \n 9     2 Hosp_Place_2_2   Rome  \n10     2 Hosp_Outcome_2_2 alive \n11     2 Hosp_Place_2_3   London\n12     2 Hosp_Outcome_2_3 alive \n13     3 Hosp_Place_1     Berne \n14     3 Hosp_Outcome_1   dead  \n15     3 Hosp_Place_2_2   <NA>  \n16     3 Hosp_Outcome_2_2 <NA>  \n17     3 Hosp_Place_2_3   <NA>  \n18     3 Hosp_Outcome_2_3 <NA>  \n\n# I could have put the following instead, meaning selecting the variables I want\n# but it was generally shorter to drop just the ID\n# patient_data %>%\n#   pivot_longer(cols = Hosp_Place_1:Hosp_Outcome_2_3)\n\nSomething clearly happened, but name and value are not exactly what we want here.\nThe colnames “name” and “value” are actually coming from the default arguments.\nWhat is now the next step?\n\n\nMental image of desired outcome - How should my dataframe look like?\nMy desired output is a dataframe with the colum names ID, Hosp_Place and Hosp_Outcome. Additionally, I want a variable - lets call it hosp_sequence - that captures the number of the hospitalisation (you remember the suffix of the original variable names).\ntidyr::pivot_longer()’s names_to =-arguments states in the help-page:\nCan be a character vector, creating multiple columns, if names_sep or names_pattern is provided.\nIf you can detect any patterns in the column names, its possible to use them for the column naming. If we look at Hosp_Place_1 and Hosp_Outcome_1 we can clearly see a pattern: The information I want as name is Hosp_Place and Hosp_Outcome and the number followed should be put in variable called hosp_sequence.\nThis translates to something like (Hosp_Place)_(1) where the parts in brackets correspond to the inputs given in names_to =. With the .value-argument, I can easily take over the string as it is.\nI actually found this very confusing (honestly - still do…) and I had great help for defining the regular expression from R4DS1.\nFinally, this is the code we need:\n\n# this code should do the trick\npatient_data %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = -ID, \n               names_to = c(\".value\", \"hosp_sequence\"),\n               names_pattern = '(^[A-z]+_[A-z]+)_([0-9].*)')\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 4\n     ID hosp_sequence Hosp_Place Hosp_Outcome\n  <dbl> <chr>         <chr>      <chr>       \n1     1 1             London     Alive       \n2     1 2_2           Paris      alive       \n3     1 2_3           Rome       dead        \n4     2 1             Paris      alive       \n5     2 2_2           Rome       alive       \n6     2 2_3           London     alive       \n7     3 1             Berne      dead        \n8     3 2_2           <NA>       <NA>        \n9     3 2_3           <NA>       <NA>        \n\n\nWait, what is happening with rows 8 and 9?

This is closer to the idea of data in a spreadsheet than the mirrored version with tibble() or data.frame().\n\ndf <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~id, ~pesnwi_leadership, ~pesnwi_sra, ~bernca_adl, ~bernca_docu,\n  1, 2.3, 2.1, 1.8, 1.4,\n  2, 2.0, 3, 2.1, 0.9,\n  3, 3.1, 3.5, 3.9, 3\n)\n\nThis is the equivalent code for the ‘mirrored’ version:\n\ndf <- \n  data.frame(\n                   id = c(1, 2, 3),\n    pesnwi_leadership = c(2.3, 2, 3.1),\n           pesnwi_sra = c(2.1, 3, 3.5),\n           bernca_adl = c(1.8, 2.1, 3.9),\n          bernca_docu = c(1.4, 0.9, 3)\n  )\n\nFinally, this is how the dataframe looks like:\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n     id pesnwi_leadership pesnwi_sra bernca_adl bernca_docu\n  <dbl>             <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>       <dbl>\n1     1               2.3        2.1        1.8         1.4\n2     2               2          3          2.1         0.9\n3     3               3.1        3.5        3.9         3  \n\n\n\n\nManual renaming following the idea of newname = oldname. This is the approach you need to take for manual replacement of column-names (see an equivalent base-R code below). You can rename more than three variables like this, just add further combinations of newname = oldname…\n\ndf %>%\n  rename(\n    pesnwi_ls = pesnwi_leadership,\n    ration_adl = bernca_adl,\n    ration_docu = bernca_docu\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n     id pesnwi_ls pesnwi_sra ration_adl ration_docu\n  <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>       <dbl>\n1     1       2.3        2.1        1.8         1.4\n2     2       2          3          2.1         0.9\n3     3       3.1        3.5        3.9         3  \n\n\n\n\n\nOf course its also possible to rename the columns with other approaches, e.g. :\n\nnames(df)[names(df)==\"pesnwi_leadership\"] <- \"pesnwi_ls\""

    "text": "Renaming multiple columns at once\n\nRenaming based on text-patterns with dplyr::rename_with()\nIt’s possible to rename multiple column-names based on matching text-patterns (regular expression). This is great if you need to rename multiple variables with the same pattern, but it only works if you can find such a pattern. If you’re in doubt which option to choose its probably safer to do the manual method above…\nFor the example dataframe, say we want to replace the prefix “bernca” (the name of an instrument to measure rationed nursing care 1) by the more general term “ration”. This is possible with the following code:\n\ndf %>%\n  rename_with(\n    .fn = ~ stringr::str_replace(., pattern = \"bernca\", replacement = \"ration\"),\n    .cols = everything()\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n     id pesnwi_leadership pesnwi_sra ration_adl ration_docu\n  <dbl>             <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>       <dbl>\n1     1               2.3        2.1        1.8         1.4\n2     2               2          3          2.1         0.9\n3     3               3.1        3.5        3.9         3  \n\n\nBy default, all columns get considered, but we could limit this or manually define the columns with c(bernca_adl, bernca_docu). Note that I used the {stringr} package for replacing the pattern ‘bernca’ with ‘ration’."

    "text": "Renaming based on names defined in an external document (e.g. xlsx)\nImagine the following situation: a survey study with three timepoints was conducted over a timespan of 2 years: T0 as baseline, T1 = T0+12months and T2 = T0+24months.\nSome of the questions were only asked at baseline, some across all timepoints and selected variables only in T1 and T2. For several reasons (a.k.a. real-life data collection) this led to situations, where a variable named X12 in T0, did in fact not correspond to the variable named X12 in T1 and so on.\nIn total there were > 250 variables to rename and the person defining the new variables did not work with R. Thus, the solution was to store the information in an external spreadsheet and then write code to import this spreadsheet and rename based on it. But how?\nA spreadsheet was created in excel that essentially held information on the variable names of a specific questions across all time points. Additionally, the first column ‘global’ defines the new variable name that will be used across all datasets once the renaming took place. Below is a small example of how the excel-file looked like:\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    global \n    T0 \n    T1 \n    T2 \n  \n \n\n  \n    ID \n    ID \n    ID \n    ID \n  \n  \n    X1 \n    X1 \n    X3 \n    X2 \n  \n  \n    X2 \n    X4 \n    X10 \n    X11 \n  \n  \n    X3 \n     \n    X2 \n    X12 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating sample datasets\nBelow I created some sample datasets to mimic T0, T1 and T2 and the information from the spreadsheet:\nFor the data from the surveys T0, T1, T2\n\norig_t0 <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~ID, ~X1, ~X4,\n  \"A\", \"m\", 1,\n  \"B\", \"x\", 2\n)\n\norig_t1 <-  tibble::tribble(\n  ~ID, ~X3, ~X10, ~X2,\n  \"AAA\", \"f\", 1, 44,\n  \"BBB\", \"x\", 2, 56,\n)\n\norig_t2 <-  tibble::tribble(\n  ~ID, ~X2, ~X11, ~X12,\n  \"FFF\", \"f\", 2, 53,\n  \"BGG\", \"f\", 1, 23,\n)\n\nInformation from the spreadsheet\n\nname_tbl <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~global, ~T0, ~T1, ~T2,\n  \"ID\", \"ID\", \"ID\", \"ID\",\n  \"X1\", \"X1\", \"X3\", \"X2\",\n  \"X2\", \"X4\", \"X10\", \"X11\",\n  \"X3\", NA_character_, \"X2\", \"X12\"\n)\n\n\n\nUsing a named vector to rename dataframes\ncheck also this tweet by @PipingHotData: https://twitter.com/PipingHotData/status/1497014703473704965?s=20&t=TA5bW8K-wxczoaW2Q6UWCQ\nAs noted above rename() takes its inputs following the usual tidyverse-style, meaning rename(newname = oldname). This can be translated to the situation at hand by using the corresponding columns from the spreadsheet to create a named vector that has the information newname as ‘name’ and oldname as value. tibble::deframe() is suitable for this situation as described in the help-page: > deframe() converts two-column data frames to a named vector or list, using the first column as name and the second column as value.\nFor T0\n\n# create a named vector\nhelper_rename_t0 <- name_tbl %>%\n  select(global, T0) %>% # take the two variables needed\n  drop_na() %>% # drop_na() is important here \n  deframe() # deframe creates the named vector\n\n# rename with !!! \n(global_t0 <- \n  orig_t0 %>%\n    rename(!!!helper_rename_t0))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  ID    X1       X2\n  <chr> <chr> <dbl>\n1 A     m         1\n2 B     x         2\n\n\nFor T1\n\n# create a named vector\nhelper_rename_t1 <- name_tbl %>%\n  select(global, T1) %>% # take the two variables needed\n  drop_na() %>% # drop_na() is important here \n  deframe() # deframe creates the named vector\n\n# rename with !!! \n(global_t1 <- \n  orig_t1 %>%\n    rename(!!!helper_rename_t1))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  ID    X1       X2    X3\n  <chr> <chr> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 AAA   f         1    44\n2 BBB   x         2    56\n\n\nFor T2\n\n# create a named vector\nhelper_rename_t2 <- name_tbl %>%\n  select(global, T2) %>% # take the two variables needed\n  drop_na() %>% # drop_na() is important here \n  deframe() # deframe creates the named vector\n\n# rename with !!! \n(global_t2 <- \n  orig_t2 %>%\n    rename(!!!helper_rename_t2))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  ID    X1       X2    X3\n  <chr> <chr> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 FFF   f         2    53\n2 BGG   f         1    23\n\n\nFinally, using bind_rows() to combine all datasets\n\n(version1 <- bind_rows(global_t0, global_t1, global_t2))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  ID    X1       X2    X3\n  <chr> <chr> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 A     m         1    NA\n2 B     x         2    NA\n3 AAA   f         1    44\n4 BBB   x         2    56\n5 FFF   f         2    53\n6 BGG   f         1    23\n\n\nThis approach worked very well, however some elements are repeated for every dataset (creating the helper vector, renaming), thus maybe a more functional programming approach might be suitable.\n\n\nUsing functional programming to rename all dataframes at once\nThe approach above works very well, yet sometimes its nice to have the output checked to the original content as well (see if the renaming was really correct).\nThe code presented here war written with help from the R4DS-online community, specifically Tyler Smith for the first option and @jonthegeek for the 2nd one.\nFirst option\n\n# create a long df with matching variable names\nvar_names <- \n  name_tbl %>% \n  rename(to = global) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-to, names_to = \"source\", values_to = \"from\") %>% \n  select(source, from, to) %>% \n  drop_na()\n\n\n# helper function to rename the cols\nrename_cols <- function(.data, from, to) {\n  dplyr::rename(.data, \n                !!!rlang::syms(\n                  purrr::discard(\n                    rlang::set_names(from, to), is.na(from))))\n}\n\n\n# helper function to table the cols\n# to compare their content\ntable_cols <- function(.data, cols, ...) {\n  purrr::map(cols, ~ base::table(.data[[.x]]), ...)\n}\n\n\n# creating a list of all dataframes that need to be renamed\ndata_list <- list(\n  T0 = orig_t0,\n  T1 = orig_t1,\n  T2 = orig_t2\n)\n\n# Create a nested tibble, define the variables to \n# be rename for each row, apply the renaming, finbally validate the\n# data_table (original dataframe) versus the output_table (renamed dataframe)\n\nmapped_object <- \n  enframe(data_list, name = \"source\", value = \"data\") %>%\n  mutate(mapping = map(source, ~ filter(var_names, source == .))) %>%\n  hoist(mapping, from = \"from\", to = \"to\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    output = pmap(list(data, from, to), rename_cols), # renaming\n    data_table = map2(data, from, table_cols, useNA = \"always\"), # validation\n    output_table = map2(output, to, table_cols, useNA = \"always\"), # validation\n    validate = map2_lgl(data_table, output_table, identical) # validation\n  )\n\n\n# from the mapped_pbject, \n# unnest the output - don't forget to store it into its own object\nmapped_object %>% \n  select(output) %>% \n  unnest(cols = output)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  ID    X1       X2    X3\n  <chr> <chr> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 A     m         1    NA\n2 B     x         2    NA\n3 AAA   f         1    44\n4 BBB   x         2    56\n5 FFF   f         2    53\n6 BGG   f         1    23\n\n\nSecond option\nThe approach is very similar: use purrr::map2_dfr() to indicate the use of two lists (.x and .y) whereas .x is the list of the dataframes and .y is the list of the vectors with the names. The suffix _dfr() does bind_rows() to combine the results into one dataframe\n\n# rename \nmap2_dfr(\n  list(orig_t0, orig_t1, orig_t2),\n  list(name_tbl$T0, name_tbl$T1, name_tbl$T2), function(tdf, names) {\n    real_names <- name_tbl$global[!is.na(names)]\n    names <- keep(names, function(v) !is.na(v))\n    tdf %>%\n      rename(!!!rlang::syms(set_names(names, real_names)))\n  }\n)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  ID    X1       X2    X3\n  <chr> <chr> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 A     m         1    NA\n2 B     x         2    NA\n3 AAA   f         1    44\n4 BBB   x         2    56\n5 FFF   f         2    53\n6 BGG   f         1    23\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nThere are many different options on to how to rename a variable\nThis post should give an overview of some of the possibilities I have worked with\nIMHO the best solution depends on the situation at hand - choose your pick!"
