### Hi :wave:!

Iâ€™m a **registered-nurse-turned-data-lover** and PhD student at a Swiss university. 
I like to build and hack **code** to make **research processes faster, less ambiguous, more reproducible** 
and aim to provide **meaningful data insights and outputs** for use in clinical settings.     

I have experience in **data preparation and analysis** in health services research (i.e., survey studies and routinely collected data from electronic health records). My latest work includes development and implementation of **analytic workflows**  for teams with a non-technical background, including but not limited to:  

  - **multilingual reporting** of study results (descriptive & bench marked)  
  - development of several internally-used **R packages**  
  - **data visualization** for communication with research and practice stakeholders  
  - instruction, guidance and consultancy on **programming and data management**
