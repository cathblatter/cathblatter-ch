### Hi!

Iâ€™m a registered-nurse-turned-data-lover and PhD student at a Swiss university. 
I like to build and hack code to make research processes faster, less ambiguous 
and more reproducible and aim to provide meaningful data insights and outputs for use in clinical settings.

### Experience

I have broad experience in data preparation and analysis in health services research (i.e., survey studies and routinely collected data from electronic health records). My latest work includes development and implementation of analytic workflows for teams with a non-technical background, including but not limited to:  

  - multilingual reporting of study results (descriptive & bench marked)  
  - development of several internally-used R packages  
  - data visualization for communication with research and practice stakeholders  
  - Instruction, guidance and consultancy on programming / data management
