    "markdown": "---\ntitle: Installing & using multiple R versions aside\nauthor: Cath Blatter\ndate: '2021-03-06'\n---\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n- I started using the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)-package about a \nyear ago and it has saved me multiple times already. What always baffled me though was\nthe hint when opening an 'old' project where I used a previous version of R to \nset it up - how would I be able to 'switch' back to an older version of R?  \n\n- I remembered Garrick Aiden-Buie mentioning [Rswitch](https://rud.is/rswitch/) in this [thread-post](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/setting-up-a-new-macbook-pro/). \n\n- I recently took a Intro-to-Python-course and stumbled upon [{venv}](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). \nI was amazed to learn that in Python all previous versions stay available, so \nI could easily choose the version for a new virtual environment üí°\n\n# How it started\n\nThanks to google, I read numerous blog posts but did not understand much (not \na regular command-line-user)...\n\n- I gasped that using the .`pkg`-installer (double clicking through the GUI) will \nremove the previous version (noted [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Multiple-versions))  \n\n- I briefly played with the idea that instead I could unpack the `.tar.gz`-files \nand build from source as noted [here](https://rud.is/rswitch/guide/) - while I was finally \nable to run all steps (something alongside `./configure make ` etc) the version I installed was not placed in `~/Library/Frameworks/R.frameworks/` \nbut remained in `/usr/local/bin/R`  üò© \nNot confident about meddling too much there another round of google was on.  \n\n- I finally came across this answer on SO: https://stackoverflow.com/a/66155919 - \nit is pointed out, that `pkgutil --forget` should not mention the name of the \nfile I downloaded (which I did...) but the name of the pkgs inside the thing I \ndownloaded - thanks for this very helpful clarification! With new hope I did this:    \n\n# How it's going\n\n1. Download the package installer from the official page, eg. https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/bin/macosx/ \n\n2. Open the terminal and run the following line: \n \n`pkgutil --pkgs | grep -i org.r-project | xargs -I {} sudo pkgutil --forget {}`  \n\nEntering `sudo`-mode I got prompted for the admin password.  \n\n3. Open the package installer and follow the GUI-prompts as usual  \n\n4. Check with RSwitch - the new (and the old versions) should be there üéâ\n\n## Note\n\nI wrote this brief blogpost mainly for my future-self - having the steps outlined \nexplicitly will hopefully save me time in the future. It took me repeated google-sessions \nin trying to understand the official R-docs and I was very grateful for the SO-answer - maybe \nanother person might profit from this post as well - if so consider letting me know e.g. by  [tweet](https://twitter.com/cathblatter). \n\n‚ö†Ô∏è A note of caution: I do not fully understand what is really happening with the commands \nabove under the hood and I cannot be held responsible for whatever happens on your \nmachine if you follow these steps.  \nThey worked out on my computer(s) but for inquiries about what is really happening \nin the background consider following the official docs or ask on Stackoverflow!  \n\nüíª Apple Mac OS X High Sierra.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
